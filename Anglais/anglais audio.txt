There are several types of student housing. For exemple, there are homestay for the person who worried
about feeling homesick. It's good for the language and cultural immersion. 

There are also the dormitory, it's worthwhille because you can do some new local friends. 
The private student rental halls are available it's like the dorms but they're off campus.
The private apartement are interesting too if you like to be alone. But it's maybe the solution most expensive.
And a last solution, the shared apartement. You will have your private room and some shared common areas.
It's can be fun !


Personally, I would like to take a private apartement because I like to be alone, eat what i would, 
do the housework when i would like. In short, I like to do be independent . 
But the problem is the price. It's very expensive. And for the renting, there may be scammers 
out there who can take advantage of you because you don't know the country's laws for exemple.

However, I would never take the homestay I think although they are welcoming.
I won't be able to feel at ease as well as integrate properly.
